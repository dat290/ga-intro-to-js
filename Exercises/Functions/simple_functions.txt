1. Write a function that prints all the even numbers between 1 and 10,000.
Challenge: function takes an argument `divisor`
and prints all numbers between 1 and 10000
that are evenly divisible by the divisor

3. Write a function 'get_max' that takes a list of numbers and returns the max of those numbers, don't use the max() function.

4. Write a function 'is_odd_or_div_by_7' that returns True if a number is odd or divisble by 7 and False otherwise.

5. Given a list of food orders, e.g. ["burger", "fries", "burger", "tenders", "apple pie"], write a function 'get_aggregate_order_counts' that takes the list
and returns a dictionary with the different dishes as keys and the number of times they appear in the list as the values. For example,

It takes ["burger", "fries", "burger", "tenders", "apple pie"] and outputs
{
   "burger": 2,
   "fries": 1,
   "tenders": 1,
   "apple pie": 1
}
